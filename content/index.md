title: Hey hi. Welcome to Intntion

Hi, I'm Yesh. I'm a grad student studying Human Systems, Social Psychology and Digital Wellbeing. We live in a digital world and it's just going to get more and more digital. We're progressing at a phenomenal phase, no wonder, considering that we're the species that went from the first flight in 1903 to the first step on the moon in 1969, a gap of mere 66 years. 

But this progress often comes with unchecked enthusiasm, uncontrollable adaption and the worst unintentional dependence. Just ask yourself if you'd be willingly able to let go of your mobile phone and function for the next 24 hours? You'd say hell yeah, but in reality, you'll find it really hard to achieve. If you want to talk to your parents or friends you need your phone, if you need to check your calendar you need your phone, if you even wanted to move around town or make payments, guess what : you need a phone. That is the level of dependence we have today. ( Read my full essay on [[Digital Dependence]])

I have in a way become slightly aware of the negative impacts this large scale progress has on us, mainly because of my curiosity and partly because my thesis has to do something with this :). But, I'm now on a journey to discover ways to live differently and in control, in a world where control is more of an illusion or a choice. We're hit with distractions and dopamine everywhere we go, and almost every fun activity we do on the internet drains us somehow. We don't think about what we do anymore and delve into patterns of things that are detrimental. 

It's high time we consciously took decisions and and lived lives the way we want to, and thats what I wanna do, even though I have no idea how :)

Please go to [[start]], if find a structured way to go through intntion or just wander around :) You choose !!
