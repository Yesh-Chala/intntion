title: Hey hi. Welcome to Intntion
---

Hi, I'm Yesh and I'm on a journey to live a more intentional life. I've been fed up with making unconscious decisions, being led, getting addicted to dopamine, habits without my consent. 

My goal to live an intentional life began with me day dreaming of how it would be if I did everything I wanted to, and then I thought, well what's stopping me from doing this? That's when I realised the impact the society I live in, the people I spend time with and the things I interact with in the world have far more greater impact on me than I ever imagined. 

I want to bring control back into my life, bring  conscious decision making into my life and I believe when I'm able to do this, I'll find a person inside me who'll love without restraint and live without regrets. 

So, stick around for more updates as to how I explore this space.
