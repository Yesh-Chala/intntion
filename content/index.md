title: Hey hi. Welcome to Intntion
---

Hi, I'm Yesh and I'm on a journey to live a more intentional life. I don't know how exactly to do it, but I really want to figure it out. Especially in today's world where control is an illusion and you get misled and take unconscious decisions that are not good for you. 

My goal to live an intentional life began with me day dreaming of how it would be if I did everything I wanted to, and then I thought, well what's stopping me from doing this? That's when I realised the impact the society I live in, the people I spend time with and the things I interact with in the world have far more greater impact on me than I ever imagined. 

I want to bring control back into my life, bring  conscious decision making into my life and I believe when I'm able to do this, I'll find a person inside me who'll love without restraint and live without regrets. 

You can find the [[manifesto]] (It's not official, it's just a bunch of goals) here. Here are [[daily random entries]] I make when I'm musing or when I [[read]] something relevant. 

Here's a list of [[major themes]] that might interest you.
