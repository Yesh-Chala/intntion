I’ve had a new set of impressions after being in the retreat at the Hundredth Hill. These range a lot from different types of understandings of the self to, goals and directions for illuminati that i have envisioned while i was here. I have a whole set of new thoughts and ideas about what this can be and how it can be directed.

- self of identity - i think that people are forced to carry an identity that has be preordained for them by a lot of people, from their friends and family and this has been reinforced by their need for approval.
    - i believe this is one of the reasons for the mass confusion and choosing of identities that one does not identify with or choose very much.
- the amount of uncertainty that lies around people, about what they want to be or do or eat and the energy that takes to get there. so people just default.
    - what if we made a space for people to come to with the intention of doing this exact same thing, like figure out where they are, where they wish to be with conversations and stuff.
    - i mean the salons and stuff are also really good, but what about, especially in India, providing a space where people can take a breather and look down and figure out where they wanna be
    - sort of like a reflectional space, on three things, like this triangle, mind, body and soul, what ever they wanna figure out, we could do this, and this is greatly done with people.
    
an important thing i realized today, is the importance of awareness for people on things. I feel like energy is a really important part of doing things and it fuels people to do things.

It could be either bad or good energy, but they fuel people to do stuff.

energy is produced by peoples intents to do things and their need or intention and how strong it is, i mean i just now talked about having this insane urge to do whatever a friend of mine wants me to do or needs me for, that way.

energy can be produced and is also being produced for all sorts of bad things too, just because people feel it is right and true,

people need to be shown awareness about what is good and what is not.

I mean with the internet i might not need to be present in India to do this.

people need to be made aware of a lot of things.

i feel like most of the thoughts that i’ve had for a while are coming together in ways I never imagined.

- i wanna do something to let people know there is a really broad aspects of careers and things they could study.
- i wanna do something to let people know that love is really not bad and that it’s not supposed to be that way and that movies and tv shows don’t portray love in the right way.
- i wanna do something to let the curiosity of people out and let them be there own selves.
- I wanna do something to let people realize who they and what they wanna be, and what their purpose is and all.
- I also wanna do something to let people remove previously put identities and move away from expectations and bear their own expectations. become their own moulds
- i wanna do something to help people find who are different like them, but same as them as well.
- i wanna create a platform where people can ask questions and be sure they get answers from people who they trust.
- i wanna bring awareness about how it is okay to be different. how it is okay to think separately and that you do not have to face the worlds on your own, there are places you could go to and ask questions and find answers that you trust.
    - i mean when a person has questions, i believe that subconsciously they also have the answers to it, and all they’re looking for is for someone to say the exact same thing that they have in their mind.
    - i wanna provide a space where people can build all they want to.
- i wanna bring all of the curious, interesting, amazing and loving people under one organization, that is for profit and also has a non profit side and provides awareness for people.
    - awareness on.
        - careers
        - diversity
        - love
        - sex education
        - mind
        - body
        - soul
        - and anything they wish to know.
    - the for profit side, could use courses and specifically curated modules to build up stuff for schools and all, but the non profit side is for providing awareness to people about all sorts of things mentioned above.
        - to making living life better.
        - i don’t wanna say that i’m altruistic, i’m not. i wanna do something for my own satisfaction and fame ,but i wanna do something that i’m passionate about. this is something i’m passionate about.
- Basically give people the freedom and the right information that they can do whatever they wish to do, without having the need for them to feel guilty about it.

let’s work on the primary business model of it all, before coming out to people about this.
