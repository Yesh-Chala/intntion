Today I had fun reading the elephant on the brain, still on it. But the major question is that as humans we sometimes behave in ways that is not clear to us, we might do it due to [[habit]]  or some other thing, but we may not realise we're doing it until we're deep in it. This could be the same for dependency and patterns and rewards.
